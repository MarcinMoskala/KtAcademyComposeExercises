# kt.academy Compose Exercises

### Compose Screenshot Testing

This project uses the experimental Compose Screenshot Testing plugin.

#### Running Screenshot Tests

To record or update reference screenshots, run the following command:

```bash
.\gradlew.bat updateDebugScreenshotTest
```

To verify the screenshots against existing references:

```bash
.\gradlew.bat validateDebugScreenshotTest
```

#### Windows Compatibility Note

On Windows, you may encounter a `CreateProcess error=206` (Command line too long) due to the long classpath generated by the screenshot testing plugin. To mitigate this, the project is configured to use a short-path Gradle user home at `C:\G`. Ensure this directory is writable or adjust `systemProp.gradle.user.home` in `gradle.properties` to another short path if necessary.
